Being a tech leader requires making choices. These choices are not always easy, and they can have a significant impact on the organization. In this post, I will discuss some of the choices that tech leaders need to make when structuring their organizations:

## Hiring Tech Talent

There is this 10x engineer myth that might not be true in the short term, but as my experience goes, good technical decisions can create a 10x impact in the long run. Now, making good technical decisions is hardly possible to do all by yourself, and trying to be in the center of each decision will slow down the organization, and in any case isn't really feasible. At the end of the day, the person leading the project is in the best position to make the right technical decisions, and usually as a senior leader you'll be able to review the solutions but not really dive into the details.

Moreover having a small efficient team is crucial. Communication is expansive, transferring ideas and knowledge is hard, and for each new person added you have communication fee that you need to pay. So hiring people that can get the job done fast and efficiently is crucial.

In this context hiring is crucial, and setting up a great hiring pipeline from the get go is critical. I even think paying a bit more of the recruiting budget to get a great recruiter is worth it.

Another interesting point in hiring is that it really depends on the fluctuation of the market. In the early 2020's it was really hard to hire good engineers, it took months over months to fill a position, in today's market where the is not so much free money going around it's easier to find good people. So it's also something to take into account. 


I'm not saying every hire should be like that, but for a team of 8 people, having 2-3 senior engineers that you can trust can make a huge difference. They can mentor the rest of the team, and make sure that the technical decisions are sound. In many startups the money is tight and so hiring senior engineers is a big decision to make, but if the idea is sound and the market is there, it's a decision that will pay off in the long run.

## Flat Organizations

Information flow is crucial in any organization, and the more hierarchical the organization is, the more difficult it is for information to flow. This is especially true in tech organizations, where the pace of change is so fast that decisions need to be made quickly. In a flat organization, information flows more freely, and decisions can be made more quickly. This is why many tech organizations are structured as flat organizations, with few layers of management.
